shiny_4: Modify the 02-hist-app.R code by adding an additional sliderInput for the standard deviation for your normal random variables (hint: ?rnorm).
shiny_5: Modify the 02-hist-app.R code to create a table of output values using renderDataTable()
shiny_6: Create an account on shinyapps.io and upload the app from question 4. In your R script save the code used to connect and deploy your app (you don’t need to upload this to Brightspace, but you’ll use it later. Save the link to your webapp in an R script and that is what you’ll upload for question 6.
